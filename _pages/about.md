<p style="color:red;">Welcome to you, and also welcome to me!</p>

Hi there! My name is Erkel, and I’m a proboscis monkey from the mangrove forests of Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia. I’ve always been a curious soul — I dream of exploring the world, admiring its breathtaking landscapes, and tasting all the delicious foods it has to offer.
